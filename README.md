# In this Exploratory Data Analysis, I work to uncover insights in ultra running
# As an athlete, I find it is incredibly important to reflect back on past performance to catapault into the future
# In this analysis, ultra running is examined and compares the performances between men & women, seasons, distances and locations
# Additionally, this file contains data visualizations such as bar charts, violin plots and line graphs
# This data set is sourced from Kaggle and the analysis I performed was led by Ryan Nolan Data which can be found on Youtube. I want to express this analysis is not my own but that of Ryan Nolan's and I have used it to contribute to my skill building portfoilo. 
# Thanks for reading this far and enjoy the analysis ðŸ˜„
